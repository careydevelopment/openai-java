So you're a Java developer who wants to learn how to use the Microsoft OpenAI API without learning Python?

Then you've come to the right place.

The code herein will show you how to fiddle around with the OpenAI API using the Java programming language.

You'll find tutorials to go along with this code over <a href="https://careydevelopment.us/tag/openai-basics" target="_blank">at my website</a>. You should follow them in order.

## The Breakdown
The code here is broken down by tutorial section (for example, "openai-basics") and then a branch name that reflects the lesson (for example, "getting-started"). So, for example: <a href="https://github.com/careydevelopment/openai-java/tree/openai-basic/getting-started">openai-basics/getting-started</a> is the first branch in the series of tutorials.
